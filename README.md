Below is a sample GitHub `README.md` file content tailored for the deep learning image captioning project you’ve developed. It includes an overview, setup instructions, usage details, and additional sections to make it informative and user-friendly. You can adjust it based on your project specifics (e.g., repository name, additional features).

# Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model to automatically generate captions for images. Built for Jupyter Notebook, it leverages the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model from Hugging Face, combining Vision Transformer (ViT) for image feature extraction and GPT-2 for text generation. The program displays images with their generated captions inline, making it ideal for interactive exploration of image datasets.

## Features
- Generates captions for images using a pre-trained VisionEncoderDecoderModel.
- Displays images and captions directly in Jupyter Notebook using `IPython.display`.
- Supports any image file (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) from a specified directory.
- Modular design: Setup and execution are split for easy reuse.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- GPU (optional, but recommended for faster inference)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch torchvision pillow ipython
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open a new notebook to test the code.

## Usage

The project is split into two parts for use in Jupyter Notebook:

### Part 1: Setup
Run this in a cell to load the model and define functions (only once per session):
```python
import os
from IPython.display import display, Image, HTML
from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTImageProcessor, GPT2TokenizerFast
from PIL import Image as PILImage
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and processor
model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
feature_extractor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")

# Move model to GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

def generate_caption(image_path):
    """Generate a caption for the image using a deep learning model."""
    try:
        image = PILImage.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
        pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
        pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)
        output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, max_length=16, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
        caption = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
        return caption.capitalize()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error generating caption: {e}"

def display_image_with_caption(image_path, caption):
    """Display the image and caption in the Jupyter Notebook."""
    if os.path.exists(image_path):
        display(HTML(f"<h3>{caption}</h3>"))
        display(Image(filename=image_path))
    else:
        print(f"Error: {image_path} not found.")
```

### Part 2: Execution
Run this in a separate cell to display an image with its caption. Update `image_path` as needed:
```python
# Define the image path directly
image_path = r"F:\ai_setup\ai_setup\Scripts\prashanthi\image\projects2\Images\375171241_0302ad8481.jpg"

# Generate caption using deep learning
caption = generate_caption(image_path)

# Display the image with its generated caption
display_image_with_caption(image_path, caption)
```

## Example Output
For an image like `375171241_0302ad8481.jpg`:
- **Caption**: "A vibrant market scene" (example; actual caption depends on image content).
- **Display**: The image appears below the caption in the notebook.

If the image isn’t found:
```
Error: F:\ai_setup\ai_setup\Scripts\prashanthi\image\projects2\Images\375171241_0302ad8481.jpg not found.
```

## Directory Structure
```
image-captioning/
│
├── Images/                  # Folder containing your images (e.g., 375171241_0302ad8481.jpg)
├── notebook.ipynb           # Jupyter Notebook file with the code
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Customization
- **Caption Length**: Adjust `max_length` in `generate_caption` (e.g., `max_length=32` for longer captions).
- **Model**: Replace `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` with another model (e.g., `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`).
- **Image Path**: Update `image_path` to point to your image directory.

## Troubleshooting
- **Model Download**: Ensure internet access for the first run to download the model (~1.5 GB).
- **Image Not Found**: Verify the image exists at the specified path.
- **GPU Issues**: If CUDA fails, the code defaults to CPU.
